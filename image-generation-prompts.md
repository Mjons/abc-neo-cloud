## Implementation Notes

### Image Optimization Guidelines

When generating and implementing these images, follow these best practices to ensure optimal website performance and visual quality:

**Resolution Standards:**
- Hero backgrounds should be at least 3840×2160 (4K) to support high-resolution displays
- Section backgrounds can be 2560×1440 (QHD) for balance between quality and file size
- Icons and UI elements should be 512×512 or larger for crisp rendering
- Team photos and portraits should be minimum 1024×1024 for profile displays

**File Format Selection:**
- Use **WebP** format for photographs when browser support allows (90% smaller than JPEG)
- Use **PNG** for images requiring transparency or sharp edges (logos, icons, diagrams)
- Use **JPEG** for complex photographs without transparency needs
- Consider **SVG** for simple geometric shapes and icons when possible

**Compression Strategy:**
- Compress all images before deployment using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
- Target file sizes: Hero images under 500KB, section backgrounds under 300KB, icons under 50KB
- Use progressive JPEG encoding for large images to improve perceived load time
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

**Responsive Considerations:**
- Generate multiple sizes for hero images (mobile: 1920×1080, tablet: 2560×1440, desktop: 3840×2160)
- Use CSS `background-size: cover` for backgrounds to ensure proper scaling
- Implement `srcset` attributes for responsive image delivery
- Consider art direction changes for mobile vs desktop (different crops or compositions)

### Color Consistency

All generated images should adhere to the established color palette to maintain brand consistency across the website. The primary colors are deep tech blue (#0A1628) and electric cyan (#00D9FF), with supporting gradients and accent colors in the teal and blue spectrum.

### Alternative Generation Tools

These prompts are optimized for use with various AI image generation platforms including:
- **Midjourney** (recommended for photorealistic data center imagery)
- **DALL-E 3** (excellent for abstract concepts and infographics)
- **Stable Diffusion** (customizable for specific technical requirements)
- **Adobe Firefly** (integrated workflow for design assets)

Adjust prompt syntax and parameters based on the specific tool being used, as each platform has unique strengths and formatting requirements.
